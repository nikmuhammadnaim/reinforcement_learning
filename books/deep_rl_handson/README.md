# Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On (2nd Edition)

All the codes in this folder are based on the amazing book by [Maxim Lapan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shmuma/?originalSubdomain=ru)

Instead of copy and paste, I decided to re-type the codes to help my learning and understanding of the concept. Hence, some of the code will have minor differences with the original (such as extra comments or style) to help my personal learning.
